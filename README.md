# multi-step-form

Hey, I'll be adding my notes from each session as I go through this!

## Session 1 (2h)

So for this first session I had the objective of building the entire layout, without any interactivity. There's a few reasons why I usually do this when approaching a new problem:

1. Sets the context of the work and puts everything in place in the UI
2. Creates a visual playground to start adding interactivity/features
3. Can be used for tests so we take a more TDD-like approach

I'm used to using a design system or component library and in this case I wanted to take this opportunity to also learn something new so I decided to try the [react-spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/) library that was recently open-sourced by Adobe as an extension to their design system. I had never used it before so the majority of the time was spent going through the documentation and playing with it for a bit, it was fun though!

The library seems to be a bit too restrictive to my personal taste but I can see the appeal of limiting the options in such large organisation like Adobe. There's also a big focus on the accessibility of the system, which was one of my main motivations to try it, so I'll use it as much as possible for tests.

But enough about that, for the next session it will be all about the state! In pretty sure I'm going to go with xstate for it, but I'll explain the reasoning behind that in the next session.

See ya!
